## Abstract
A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Motivation
The motivation is critical for BIPs that want to change the protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.

## Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations.

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work.

## Implementation
The implementation must be completed before any BIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the BIP is accepted. It is better to finish the implementation code before writing the BIP, but not mandatory.

## Backward Compatibility
All BIPs that introduce backward incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The BIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.

## Security Considerations
All BIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change.
