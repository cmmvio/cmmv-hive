## üöÄ Key Components

### 1. TypeScript Foundation
- **Primary Language**: TypeScript 5.x with strict mode
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+ with ES2022 target
- **Type Safety**: 100% typed codebase with zero `any` types
- **Integration**: Seamless CMMV ecosystem compatibility

### 2. Monorepo Management (Turborepo)
- **Build System**: Parallel execution with intelligent caching
- **Structure**: Organized apps/, packages/, and tools/ hierarchy
- **Performance**: <2 minute full build times
- **Scalability**: Support for complex multi-project structures

### 3. Testing Framework (Vitest)
- **Framework**: Vitest with native TypeScript support
- **Coverage**: >95% target for critical components
- **Performance**: Significantly faster than Jest
- **Features**: Built-in coverage, watch mode, debugging

### 4. Code Quality (ESLint + Prettier)
- **Standards**: Strict TypeScript and security rules
- **Automation**: Pre-commit hooks and CI/CD integration
- **Consistency**: Uniform code style across all projects
- **IDE Integration**: Seamless Cursor/VS Code support

### 5. Cryptography (ECC)
- **Algorithm**: secp256k1 curve for digital signatures
- **Library**: noble-secp256k1 (TypeScript-native)
- **Security**: Industry-standard cryptographic practices
- **Performance**: <100ms signature verification
