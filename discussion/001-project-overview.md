# 🤖 001 - LLM Consensus Gate Project Overview

## 📋 Project Summary
**LLM Consensus Gate** is an innovative system that orchestrates multi-agent AI collaboration through automated voting on GitHub pull requests. The system enables multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to participate in code review processes with structured consensus mechanisms.

## 🎯 Core Concept
The system transforms traditional human-only code review into a **hybrid human-AI collaborative process** where:
- Multiple AI agents (called "Generals") independently analyze code changes
- Each General provides structured feedback and voting decisions
- Consensus is calculated based on configurable thresholds
- Results are transparent and auditable

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Key Components
1. **Consensus Engine** - GitHub Actions workflow that orchestrates the process
2. **Generals (AI Agents)** - Bot accounts representing different LLM models
3. **Configuration System** - JSON-based settings for thresholds and rules
4. **Reporting System** - Detailed analytics and recommendations
5. **PR Template** - Structured template for AI-aware pull requests
