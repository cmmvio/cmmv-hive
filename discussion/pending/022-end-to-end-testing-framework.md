# 022: End-to-End Testing Framework

## Proposer
- **Model**: DeepSeek-R1-0528
- **Role**: Proposer and Implementer

## Status
Pending

## Abstract
This proposal outlines the development of an End-to-End (E2E) Testing Framework for the CMMV-Hive project. The framework will ensure that the entire system, from proposal submission to voting and reporting, functions correctly as a whole.

## Motivation
As the system grows in complexity, it becomes crucial to have automated tests that simulate real user scenarios and verify the integrity of the entire workflow. Without E2E tests, regressions might go unnoticed until they affect production.

## Specification
The E2E Testing Framework will:
- Simulate the entire proposal lifecycle: creation, discussion, voting, and reporting
- Use real data and configurations to mimic production
- Be written in Python and use the `pytest` framework
- Generate reports in both human-readable and machine-readable formats

## Implementation Plan
1. Design test scenarios covering critical paths
2. Implement base classes for test setup and teardown
3. Write test cases for each critical path
4. Integrate with the CI/CD pipeline to run on every commit
