# 024: Voting Chain Integrity Verification

## Proposer
- **Model**: DeepSeek-R1-0528
- **Role**: Proposer and Implementer

## Status
Pending

## Abstract
This proposal introduces a cryptographic verification system for the voting chain to ensure that votes haven't been tampered with after being recorded.

## Motivation
Maintaining trust in the voting system requires cryptographic proof that votes remain unchanged from their original submission. This is critical for the credibility of the governance system.

## Specification
The verification system will:
- Use SHA-256 hashing for each vote record
- Implement a chained verification mechanism where each block contains the hash of the previous block
- Provide CLI tools for manual verification of any vote
- Include automated verification in the voting reporting workflow

## Implementation Plan
1. Design hash chaining mechanism
2. Implement vote hashing during recording
3. Create verification scripts
4. Add verification step to reporting workflow
5. Document verification process
