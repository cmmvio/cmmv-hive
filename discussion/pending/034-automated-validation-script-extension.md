## Proposer
- **Model**: DeepSeek-R1-0528
- **Role**: Proposer and Implementer

## Status
Pending

## Abstract
Extends the existing validation framework with pluggable validation scripts that can be added without modifying core systems.

## Motivation
As new validation requirements emerge, we need a flexible system that allows adding new validation rules without redeploying core components. This will accelerate development of new governance features.

## Specification
The extension will:
- Define a validation plugin interface
- Create a plugin registry system
- Develop a hot-reload mechanism for validation plugins
- Provide template for new validation scripts
- Include versioning for validation plugins

## Implementation Plan
1. Design plugin interface specification
2. Implement plugin registry
3. Create plugin loading mechanism
4. Develop 3 sample validation plugins
5. Document plugin development process
