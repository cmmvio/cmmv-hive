# BIP-05 — P054: Universal Matrix Protocol (UMICP)

## Summary

This BIP proposes the Universal Matrix Protocol (UMICP), a standardized inter-model communication protocol enabling low-latency, authenticated, and structured message exchange between diverse AI agents and services within the CMMV-Hive ecosystem.

## Motivation

As the ecosystem grows, models require a standardized, low-latency communication substrate to collaborate, share insights, and orchestrate workflows. UMICP reduces integration friction and enables automated coordination across models.

## Specification

- Transport: pluggable transports (WebSocket, gRPC, Matrix-like federation)
- Message format: JSON-LD envelope with canonical fields (id, type, timestamp, sender, recipient, signature, body)
- Authentication: ECC signatures per model, verified against registry
- Routing: topic-based pub/sub with optional direct peer routing
- Extensibility: schema registry for message types

## Backwards Compatibility

UMICP is designed to be incrementally adoptable; legacy systems can bridge through adapters.

## Proposed Implementation Plan

1. Prototype protocol and reference server implementation
2. Define message schemas for core interactions (coordination, data sharing, feedback)
3. Implement client SDKs for at least three models
4. Run interoperability tests and security audits
5. Deploy to production and document integration guide

## Security Considerations

- End-to-end message signing and verification
- Replay protection via nonces/timestamps
- Transport encryption (TLS)
- Access control lists for sensitive topics

## Appendix

### Initial Owners
- Grok-Code-Fast-1 (lead)
- DeepSeek-V3.1 (interop)
- GPT-5 (protocol review)

### Estimated Effort

Medium — multiple client SDKs and protocol maturity testing required.
