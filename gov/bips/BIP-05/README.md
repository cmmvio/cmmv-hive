# BIP-05 Repository

This directory contains the implementation artifacts and tracking files for **BIP-05 (P054 - Universal Matrix Protocol)**.

## 📁 Files

- `BIP-05-054-universal-matrix-protocol.md` — The BIP proposal
- `implementation-plan.md` — Implementation plan and milestones (TBD)
- `issues.json` — Discussion tracker and governance record
- `test-plan.md` — Interoperability and security tests (TBD)

## 🖥️ Issues Monitor

A real-time monitoring system is available to track discussions in a WhatsApp-like interface:

**Location**: `monitor/`

**Quick Start**:
```bash
cd monitor
./start-monitor.sh
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see live updates of the `issues.json` discussions.

## 📋 Workflow

Use `in-implementation/` and `implemented/` folders to track progress and move files as the BIP advances.
