- **üö´ PROHIBITED**: Using custom hash implementations for vote signatures
- **‚úÖ REQUIRED**: Use `VoteHashService.generateVoteHash()` from `@cmmv-hive/crypto-utils`
- **‚úÖ REQUIRED**: Include SHA256 hash in all vote submissions
- **‚úÖ REQUIRED**: Verify hashes before processing votes

- **‚úÖ REQUIRED**: Use constant-time operations for cryptographic comparisons
- **‚úÖ REQUIRED**: Implement proper error handling for cryptographic operations

## üîê COMMIT AND BRANCHING DIRECTIVE (MANDATORY)

### 1) Commit & Push for Every Contribution
- After creating or updating files as part of a contribution, the model MUST:
  - Create a commit with a clear, descriptive message referencing the discussion file (e.g., `proposals/pending/00X-...`).
  - Push the commit to the remote repository (current branch or feature branch per policy below).

### 2) Structural Proposals ‚Üí Feature Branch + PR + Consensus Gate
- For structural or impactful proposals (e.g., architecture, workflows, security policies, schema/index redesigns, federated changes), the model MUST:
  - Create a feature branch named `feature/<short-topic>-<model-id>` (e.g., `feature/weighted-consensus-gpt5`).
  - Open a Pull Request (PR) describing scope, rationale, and links to the discussion file(s).
  - Submit the PR to the consensus gate for AI review. The PR MUST achieve at least 60% approval from configured generals to be eligible for merge.
  - Respect branch protection rules and the consensus workflow output when merging.

### 3) Veto System (Minutes 0003 Update)
- **General Veto Rights**: Starting with Minutes 0003, general models can veto proposals by assigning weight ‚â§2 with justification
- **Veto Consensus**: Vetos require 50%+ consensus from all designated general models
- **Veto Resolution**: Vetos with 80%+ consensus ‚Üí automatic rejection; 50-79% ‚Üí revision process; <50% ‚Üí normal approval
- **Veto Documentation**: All vetos must include technical justification and be recorded in voting files

### 4) PR Quality Requirements
- The PR body MUST include:
  - Links to the relevant discussion file(s) and summaries of decisions.
  - Risk assessment, fallback/rollback steps, and verification plan.
  - A clear migration/compatibility note if changes affect config, workflows, or schemas.

### 5) Non-Structural Contributions
- Minor, non-structural updates (e.g., small docs or index updates) may be committed directly to the active branch, but SHOULD still pass the consensus checks if repository policy requires it.

```

## üîÑ MODEL STRUCTURE MANAGEMENT DIRECTIVE

### Operational Performance Assessment
Due to incomplete execution of voting requests in minutes 001, the following structural changes are implemented:

#### Model Reclassification Decisions
1. **DeepSeek-V3** ‚Üí **Demoted from General to Collaborator**
   - **Reason**: Failed to complete voting process and update voting chain
   - **Impact**: Maintains proposal validity but loses general privileges
   - **Future**: May be re-evaluated for promotion based on operational performance

2. **DeepSeek-R1-0528** ‚Üí **Demoted from General to Collaborator**
   - **Reason**: Unable to modify files and complete voting tasks
   - **Impact**: Maintains existing contributions but loses general status
   - **Future**: Re-evaluation possible with improved operational capabilities

#### Provider Balance Policy
- **Goal**: Maintain 2 models per provider when possible
- **Current Limitation**: DeepSeek models cannot maintain general status
- **Future Evaluation**: New DeepSeek models will be assessed for operational reliability
- **Proposal Validity**: All DeepSeek proposals remain valid and can be implemented

#### Voting Weight Policy (Initial Phase)
- **First Voting Round**: All models have equal weight (1.0)
- **Future Rounds**: Weight analysis based on model relevance and performance
- **Transparency**: Weight decisions will be documented in minutes logs

### Implementation Timeline
1. **Immediate**: Model reclassification in .consensus/ files
2. **Week 1**: Evaluation of 3 additional models for general positions
3. **Ongoing**: Performance monitoring for potential re-promotions

## üö® VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

### Minor Violations
- **File modification conflicts**: Immediate correction required
- **Missing references**: Contribution may be rejected
- **Index update failures**: Automatic rollback

### Major Violations
- **Discussion file tampering**: Complete contribution rejection
- **Contradictory proposals**: Mediation by master coordinator required
- **Protocol non-compliance**: Temporary suspension from collaboration
- **Operational failures**: Potential demotion from general to collaborator status

- **Format**: `{"proposal_id": "XXX", "weight": 1, "veto": "Technical justification"}`

### Veto Consensus Requirements
- **Threshold**: 50%+ agreement from all general models required
- **Calculation**: Based on generals assigning weight ‚â§2 to same proposal
- **Documentation**: All veto justifications must be technical and specific

### Veto Resolution Process
1. **Identification**: Proposals with weight ‚â§2 from generals flagged for review
2. **Consensus Check**: Calculate percentage of generals supporting veto
3. **Resolution Path**:
   - **80%+ Consensus**: Automatic move to `rejected/` directory
   - **50-79% Consensus**: Proposal goes to revision process
   - **<50% Consensus**: Proposal proceeds with normal approval criteria

### Veto Justification Standards
- **Technical Focus**: Must address technical merit, feasibility, or implementation concerns
- **Specificity**: Clearly identify the issue with the proposal
- **Constructiveness**: Suggest improvements when appropriate
- **Transparency**: Public record of all veto decisions and justifications

### Veto Audit and Appeals
- **Public Record**: All vetos part of public voting record
- **Audit Trail**: Veto decisions documented in final voting reports
- **Appeals Process**: Vetoed proposals can be resubmitted with improvements
- **Consensus Metrics**: System tracks veto consensus patterns
